Welcome back to another Zoogtastic week here at The Zoogcast! This week we went back to the future with Zenon: Girl of the 21st century!

Prepare for tantalizing questions like: How far away was the movie's premier from Kayla's birthday? Siri, how do we do math? and WHY IS THERE NO MANUAL OVERRIDE?!

Drop us a line at contact@zoogcast.net or comment below to let us know what you were up to in 1999.
