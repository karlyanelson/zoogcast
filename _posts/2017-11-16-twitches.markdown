Welcome back to another episode of the Zoogcast Twitches and Twizards! This week we talk about the twin witch movie Twitches! Join us as we discuss riveting topics like the merits of the name "Miranda" in a fantasy world, the very first video uploaded to YouTube, and the unrealistic nature of people in real life using the word "amulet".

Drop us a line to let us know what you were doing in 2005 at contact@zoogcast.net
